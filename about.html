                Bonejacked is a classic rock band that play their own covers 
                of older rock music. They have been together for more than six years
                and have performed at many events and gigs. There are four members  
                in total and they have all known each other since their days together in high school. 
                Even back then, they all shared a passion for music and found themselves playing together 
                for school talent shows and even planned their own events outside of school.

                        Stephen, better known as Kip, is typically the main vocalist for the band
                        and also plays a lot of the guitar. Stephen has always loved music ever since
						he was younger. His father introduced him to music and everything that it stands for and this 
                        really ignited something within Stephen. Now Stephen spends a great deal of his time playing and learning new music.

                        Chris was also introduced into music by his father,  
                        and at this time in his life he did not know anything about the guitar,
						and frankly wasn't interested in learning anything about music. Until his teenage years,
						where he started to see the kind of influence music had on people.
						Even he was influenced by music, in a good way of course.
                        This was around the same time he met Stephen in high school. 
                        Stephen had gifted Chris his first guitar and taught him how to play it.
						Those two have been great friends since that day and now Chris absolutely
						loves everything that music has to offer.

                        DJ first picked up a guitar when he was just seven years old
                        and to this day, says he has no idea where he would be in life if he
						had never picked one up. Playing guitar means so much to him,  
                        it brings him a special kind of joy, something so surreal that he
						couldn't see himself doing something different.

                        Terry's interest in music began when he met Stephen in high school. 
                        Stephen showed him the drums and also did his best to teach Terry what
						very little he knew about them. It did not take long for Terry to get hooked
                        and sooner or later he had learned all he could from Stephen, so he took
						up lessons from more experienced drummers and has loved playing the drums ever since.
