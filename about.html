                Bonejacked is a classic rock band that play their own covers 
                of older rock music. They have been together for more than six years
                and have performed at many events and gigs. There are four members  
                in total and they have all known each other since their days together in high school. 
                Even back then, they all shared a passion for music and found themselves playing together 
                for school talent shows and even planned their own events outside of school.

			Stephen, better known as Kip, is the band's main vocalist and also plays the guitar.
			Growing up, Stephen learned to love music through his father, who also plays the guitar.
			Over time, Stephen realized that he had a genuine passion for music and nowadays
			devotes a great deal of his time to playing and learning new music.

			Similar to Stephen's story, Chris was introduced to music by his father.
			Originally, he did not know anything about playing the guitar and was quite disinterested about anything related to music.
			It was during his teenage years that he understood the positive impact music could have on people.
			This was around the same time that he met Stephen in school and learned to play the guitar with Stephen's guidance.
			Since then, Chris has refined his understanding of playing guitar and his friendship with Stephen continues to this day.

			DJ first picked up the guitar when he was seven years old.
			To this day, he says he has no idea where he would be in life if he had never picked up the instrument.
			Playing guitar brings him a special sense of fulfillment and joy,
			something that no other occupation has been able to bring him.

			He learned all he could from Stephen and continued to take up lessons from more experienced drummers afterwards.
